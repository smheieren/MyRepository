<ul>
	<li class="news">An advantage of CSS is that typography and page layout can be
	 better controlled. Features such as font size, letter spacing, and element position
	  can be adjusted easily.</li>
	<li>Another advantage is that style is separate from structure. Formatting text and
	 colors can be configured separately and stored and applied to multiple web pages.</li>
	<li>A third advantage is that it makes site maintenance easy. When styles need to be 
	changed, modifying the style sheet alone can make the necessary changes.</li>
